In this project, we would like to develop a model that helps to evaluate the prices of used cars for the dealers and individuals. We are going to use the dataset that includes the sales data from Craigslist, which is the worldâ€™s largest collection of used vehicle sales. This dataset contains more extensive and comprehensive information compared to that accessible to the agents. It includes city, year, make, condition and some other variables that are critical when estimating the car price.

This model will take large amount of existing data, find a particular pattern and make predictions of price with given variables based on the observed pattern, which has similar logic as how the agents make estimation. Since machine could deal with big data with higher speed, we firmly believe that it could successfully take the job.
